      section
        h2 ECMA262 defines how these Records are instantiated
        h3 and how they are represented in memory

      section
        h3 We made all modules in the graph
        h2 Async

      section
        h3 To do this we abstracted code from the
        h2 Async Function Specification
        h3 for instantiation of Module Records in the graph

      section
        h3 With this infrastructure in place
        h2 Every module would now have a promise capability
        h3 Allowing for deferred execution at the Top-Level

      section
        h3 We were able to defer execution by calling
        h2 Spec-Level Await on the execution of the module
        h3 Yes, the spec has it's own abstractions

      section
        h3 this algorithm supports Variant A
        h2 A spec level Promise.all would add support
        h3 for Variant B

      section
        h3 as such we were able to defer
        h2 making a decision
        h2 on A versus B
        h3 Unblocking Objections to either semantics

      section
        h3 We clarified that the feature would only be supported
        h2 In the module goal
        h3 Unblocking objections about interoperability

      section
        h3 We deferred to current behavior
        h2 For handling deadlock
        h3 Unblocking objections related to cycles

      section
        h3 In may of 2018
        h2 Top-Level Await
        h2 went to stage 2

      section
        h1 Chapter Seven

      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='cyber-punk')
        h2 What's next?

      section
        h3 I want to move forward
        h2 With Variant B
        h3 We need to build consensus around these semantics

      section
        h3 We are going through a variety of examples
        h2 To define semantics for deadlock
        h3 The intent is to make things fail early and obviously

      section
        h3 We need to finish writing the spec text
        h2 The text then needs to be reviewed and approved
