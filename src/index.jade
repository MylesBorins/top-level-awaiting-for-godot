        h1 Potential Solutions

      section
        h2 Variant A
        h3.slim A call to top-level await would block execution in the graph until it had resolved.

      section
        h2 Variant B
        h3.slim A call to top-level await would block execution of child nodes in the graph but would allow siblings to continue to execute.

      section
        h2 Variant C
        h5.headroom.slim Many of the use cases for top-level await are for bootstrapping an application. Enforcing that top-level await could only be used inside of a module without exports would allow individuals to use many of the patterns they would like to use in application bootstrapping while avoiding the edge cases of graph blocking or deadlocks.
